2. **Simulation Setup**
   Detail the parameters, assumptions, and methods used in the simulation. Include descriptions of the energy calculations and phase shift conditions.

   ```markdown
   ### Simulation Setup
   #### Parameters and Assumptions
   - **Mass of Individual (m)**: 70 kg
   - **Step Frequency (f)**: 1 step per second
   - **Height (h)**: 1.75 meters
   - **Gravitational Acceleration (g)**: 9.81 m/sÂ²
   - **Resonance Factor (R)**: 0.5
   - **Water Content (W)**: 67%

   #### Energy Calculations
   The simulation calculates kinetic energy (KE), potential energy (PE), and resonance energy (RE) at each iteration, summing them to determine the total energy (TE). The phase shift condition is met if TE exceeds the phase factor threshold.

   **Kinetic Energy (KE):**


   KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
   

**Potential Energy (PE):**


   PE = mgh
   

**Resonance Energy (RE):**


   RE = W \times R
   

   **Total Energy (TE):**


   TE = KE + PE + RE
   

   #### Phase Shift Condition
   The phase shift is achieved if the total energy (TE) exceeds the phase factor threshold, set at 1000 J for this simulation.
