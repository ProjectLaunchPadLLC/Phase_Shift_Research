### **Introduction**

The concept of phase shifting and dimensional phasing offers intriguing possibilities for advanced propulsion mechanisms. By manipulating the energy states of an object, it is theoretically possible to achieve a phase alignment that allows for seamless traversal through various mediums with minimal resistance. This study aims to explore the feasibility of these concepts through a detailed simulation, analyzing the resulting data to understand energy dynamics and phase shift conditions.

### **Simulation Setup**

#### **Parameters and Assumptions**
- **Mass (m)**: 70 kg
- **Step Frequency (f)**: 1 step per second
- **Height (h)**: 1.75 meters
- **Gravitational Acceleration (g)**: 9.81 m/sÂ²
- **Resonance Factor (R)**: 0.5
- **Water Content (W)**: 67%

#### **Energy Calculations**
- **Kinetic Energy (KE)**:


  KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
  

- **Potential Energy (PE)**:


  PE = mgh
  

- **Resonance Energy (RE)**:


  RE = W \times R
  

- **Total Energy (TE)**:


  TE = KE + PE + RE
  

#### **Phase Shift Condition**
The phase shift is considered achieved if the total energy exceeds a predefined phase factor threshold (1000 J in the simulation).

### **Data Analysis**

#### **Simulation Results**
The simulation was run for 30 iterations, logging the kinetic, potential, and resonance energies for each iteration, along with the total energy and whether the phase shift condition was met.
